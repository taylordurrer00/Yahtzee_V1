--------------------------------------------------------[    DESCRIPTION    ]--

This is the first phase of remaking an old yahtzee game I made during 10th 
grade in high school.  I wanted to use what I learned after a year at UCSD to
make a much-improved version of the old game.  The goal of this phase was to
make a largely similar version of the old game with much better underlying
code.  This version is much more object-oriented and modular.  This may not
have been the best way to code this particular game, however I learned a lot
about object oriented programming at school so that is what I wanted to 
practice.  I wanted to keep this version almost identical to the old version so
the only difference would be the underlying code improvements.  I did, however,
make a few improvements including: a resizeable window, a more aesthetically
pleasing layout, and the ability to score after any roll (not just after the
third roll).
